Project two is where we begin to learn basic scripting with gitbash. I followed the directions and did not really have any problems until the end where I could not figure out the directory for the backup. My first attempt on Project 2 went rather poorly as I was getting several errors when I had to solve some directory issues. I continued to have three attempts until I got it correct.

The whole project was a great learning experience and really shows how important scripting and github can be.
