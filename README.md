Project two is where we begin to learn basic scripting with gitbash. I followed the directions and did not really have any problems until the end where I could not figure out the directory for the backup. My first attempt on Project 2 went rather poorly as I was getting several errors when I had to solve some directory issues. I continued to have three attempts until I got it correct.

The whole project was a great learning experience and really shows how important scripting and github can be. 

CODE REVIEW Jeffery Rodriguez 

I would like to start by saying all of your scripts were neat and easy to read as stated in the comments for each. 
As for my suggestions, I would just say to keep it up! Great work. I did not see a for.sh script. But other than 
that, everything was solid.
